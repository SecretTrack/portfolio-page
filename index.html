        <p class="about-gabriel">
          I'm a developer student with a passion for games and a thirst for
          knowledge. Currently, I'm on my journey to becoming a full-stack
          developer, equipped with foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and basic
          JavaScript. I'm pursuing a degree in System Analysis and Development,
          where I'm diving deep into the world of technology. Living in Rio de
          Janeiro, I have a love/hate relationship with the sun—it keeps me warm
          but sometimes a bit too toasty! On the brighter side, I absolutely
          adore cats and find joy in their playful antics. I'm excited to keep
          learning and growing in this ever-evolving field!

            <p>
              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the backbone of my web
              development projects. I utilize HTML to create structured and
              semantic web pages, ensuring accessibility and SEO best practices
              are integrated into my work.

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>
              With CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), I bring my web designs to life.
              I focus on responsive design, ensuring that my websites look great
              on all devices. I enjoy experimenting with layouts, animations,
              and visual effects to enhance user experience.

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
              JavaScript is my tool for adding interactivity to web
              applications. I use it to manipulate the DOM, handle user events,
              and create dynamic content. My understanding of basic JavaScript
              enables me to develop engaging and responsive features.
